- [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) framework from Development Seed

- Used tutorials of [Spatial Thoughts](https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/python-dataviz/), QGIS tutorial of [https://ecodiv.earth/](https://ecodiv.earth/post/animal_tracking-data/#ref-moritz2018) and [Dr Quisheng Wu](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAxJ4-o7ZoPfb18kNe2luWX9xKg1233i9)

## Notebooks

1. [prepare_data](prepare_data.ipynb): This takes the original .csv file from Movebank and convert it into a Geopandas dataframe for further analysis. Very basic plotting.

2. [basics_lonboard_cattle]('notebooks/basics_lonboard_cattle.ipynb) - Main analysis using the Leaflet/DeckGL backend.
