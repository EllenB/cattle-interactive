        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, cattle movement during the day and the night is visualised using an interactive plot using Leafmap with Lonboard at the backend.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data have been prepared in another script as the raw data from Movebank are in the form of a .csv file and the data need to be converted to a Geopandas dataframe for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code uses the [cattle data from Movebank of [Moritz et al.](https://ecodiv.earth/post/animal_tracking-data/#ref-moritz2018)](https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study412206724) [1][2] and makes an interactive plot using the package [Leafmap with Deckgl](https://leafmap.org/deckgl/#leafmap.deckgl.apply_continuous_cmap) at the backend. This package is developed by [Quisheng Wu](https://wetlands.io/).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation for this code is that during Day 5 of the [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) where the topic was \"movement\", I decided to study movement of animals and use the amazing Movebank dataset. There is a wealth of data on the Movebank website and quite a lot of data you can download for free.\n",
        "\n",
        "I use the same data as the excellent QGIS tutorial of [Ecodiv.earth](https://ecodiv.earth/post/animal_tracking-data/#ref-moritz2018) [3]. Inititially (having only one day of time), I struggled getting my way around in Movebank as I was overwhelmed with the choices and new to exploring. The only time I had downloaded some data of Movebank is for a book review using some data from Movebank (on cougars).\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, I aimed for the sky and wanted to create an animated visualisation in Folium (since I am new to animation in Python). After a few lines of code in Folium, I realised that Folium crashed. I was wondering why just visualising the data just crashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time of writing, I was also listening to the daily YouTube videos of Ujaval Gandhi's course on [Mapping & Data visualisation in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLppGmFLhQ1HLzGl8auwYkdUMu_z0Hz7G6) [3][4] and he mentioned that Folium will crash. It is then that I realised that there is something called \"Lonboard\" developed by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) and that Leafmap interacts with Lonboard. Added to this, the Leafmap lectures of Quisheng Wu in his \"Intro to Programming\" course are also super useful and amazing for understanding the basics of Leafmap [5].  \n",
        "\n",
        "The script below is still very  basic but at least I realised that there are tremendous resources out there in the form of datasets ([Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main), software people have written [Leafmap](https://leafmap.org/) and [Lonboard]() and tutorials ([Spatial Thoughts](https://spatialthoughts.com/) and [Quisheng Wu](https://www.youtube.com/@giswqs) and that I have just scratched the surface!\n",
        "\n",
        "As pointed out in the video lectures of Spatial Thoughts, the syntax for creating the maps differs whether you use points, lines, etc. Unlike the tutorial of Ujaval Gandhi that uses lines (rivers), this Movebank dataset has points. For points, one needs to refer to the [Lonboard documentation for points](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/scatterplot-layer/#lonboard.ScatterplotLayer).\n",
        "\n",
        "This code is very basic as of now so comments are welcome (through Github issues) or other. Thank you for reading!"
